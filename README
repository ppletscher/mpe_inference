simple MEX wrapper to perform MAP (sometimes also called MPE, for most probable
explanation) inference for binary energies and pairwise graphs. The code for
the actual inference is written by other people and you should consult the
corresponding READMEs for questions about the copyright or how to
appropriately cite their works in any of your publications.

Algorithms packaged:
* Boykov-Kolmogorov Maximum flow
* Maximum Flow byIncremental Breadth-First Search
