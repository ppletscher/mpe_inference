simple MEX wrapper to perform MAP inference for binary energies and pairwise
graphs. The code for the actual inference is written by other people and you
should consult the corresponding READMEs for questions about the copyright or
how to appropriately cite their works in any publications.

Algorithms packaged:
* Boykov-Kolmogorov max-flow
* Incremental Breadth-First Search
